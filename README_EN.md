‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The script sends an HTTP GET request to the target URL https://greenway.icnet.ru/cars-sales-actual-russia.html, using predefined headers (User-Agent) to mimic a real web browser.

The retrieved HTML page content is passed to BeautifulSoup for parsing.

The parser finds all table rows (<tr>) and within each row, it searches for data cells (<td>).

The text (car model name) is extracted from the second cell of each row.

Filtering is applied: table headers ("–ú–∞—Ä–∫–∞", "–ú–æ–¥–µ–ª—å" which mean "Brand", "Model") and empty values are excluded.

The final list of models is printed to the screen.
